This lab demonstrates how the enable password works on Cisco routers and how it is affected by the service password-encryption command.

Set the enable password
Enter global configuration mode and set the password:
Router(config)# enable password flower

View the running configuration
Router# show running-config


Observation: Lab06-Image1
The password appears in plain text:
enable password flower
No encryption is applied yet.

Enable password encryption
Router(config)# service password-encryption

View the running configuration again
Router# show running-config


Observation: Lab06-Image2
The password is now encrypted using Type 7:
enable password 7 094F4A1E0A
(The encoded value will differ each time.)
Type 7 is reversible and provides only basic obfuscation, not strong security.

Disable password encryption
Router(config)# no service password-encryption

View the running configuration again
Router# show running-config

Observation:
The password remains encrypted.
Cisco IOS does not decrypt previously encrypted passwords.
The command only prevents future passwords from being encrypted.

TIP
What type of encryption is used?
Cisco Type 7 Encryption

Reversible
Weak and easily cracked
Intended only to hide plain-text passwords
Not suitable for secure environments

For real security use,
enable secret <password>
which uses Type 5 (MD5) or Type 9 (scrypt) hashing depending on IOS version.
